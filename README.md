* AGCM:

We have used the asymmetric Gaussian chirplet model (AGCM) and established a dictionary-free variant of the orthogonal matching pursuit, a greedy algorithm for sparse approximation of seismic traces.

* Decurtain:

An infimal convolution model is applied to split the corrupted 3D image into the clean image and two types of corruptions, namely a striped part and a laminar one.

* EMPCR:

We propose a simple yet efficient interpolation algorithm, which is based on the Hankel matrix, for randomly missing traces.

* RegistrationMultiComponent:

We propose a new curvelet-based registration method to improve the precision of registration, especially for the data with heavy random noises.

* DL_toolbox

We propose a simultaneous dictionary learning and denoising method for seismic data.

* DDTF3D:

We study an application of the data-driven tight frame (DDTF) method to noise suppression and interpolation of high-dimensional seis- mic data.

* MCDDTF3D:

We have designed a new patch selection method for DDTF seismic data recovery. We suppose that patches with higher variance contain more information related to complex structures, and should be selected into the training set with higher probability.

* CVMD:

We have extended varitional mode decomposition to complex-valued situation and apply CVMD to f-x spectrum of seismic for denoising.

* LDMM

We have applied low dimensional manifold method for seismic strong noise attenuation. LDMM uses a low dimensional method to approximate all the patches of seismic data.
